A command utility in Python refers to a program or script that is designed to be executed from the command line or terminal. It allows you to perform specific tasks or operations by providing inputs as command-line arguments or prompts.

Command utility programs are typically used for automating repetitive tasks, performing system operations, or dealing with large datasets. They provide a convenient way to interact with a program without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI), and can be easily integrated into scripts or used in combination with other command line tools.

In Python, command utility programs can be created using various libraries and frameworks such as argparse, click, or even the built-in sys module. These libraries provide functionalities for parsing command-line arguments, defining command-line options, and handling user input.

To create a command utility in Python, you typically follow these steps:

Import the necessary libraries or modules relevant to parsing command line arguments or handling user input.
Define the command-line arguments, options, or prompts that your utility program requires.
Implement the logic or functionality of your utility program based on the provided inputs.
Handle any error cases or invalid input scenarios gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages or usage instructions.
Test your command utility by executing it from the command line or terminal, providing the required inputs and verifying the expected output.
Overall, command utilities in Python provide a flexible and efficient way to perform specific tasks or operations from the command line, making it easier to automate tasks or interact with programs without relying on a GUI.
