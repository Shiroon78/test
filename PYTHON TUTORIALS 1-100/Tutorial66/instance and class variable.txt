In object-oriented programming, a class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class.

Here are some key differences between class and instance variables in Python:

Class variables are defined within the class body, outside of any method, and are accessible by all instances of the class. Instance variables, on the other hand, are defined inside a method, and can only be accessed within that method.
Class variables are defined once, and their value is the same for all instances of the class. Instance variables, on the other hand, are defined within each instance, and have their own unique value for each instance.
Class variables are typically used to store common data that is shared by all instances of a class, such as class-wide settings or configuration data. Instance variables, on the other hand, are used to store data that is specific to each instance of a class, such as the instance's state or attributes.
Class variables are typically defined at the module level, outside of any class, while instance 
 are defined within a class body.


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. Objects can interact with each other through methods and encapsulate state and behavior.

OOP provides several benefits, including:

Modularity: Code can be divided into smaller, more manageable units, which makes it easier to understand, maintain, and modify.
Encapsulation: Information about an object is hidden from outside access, which helps to ensure that the data remains consistent and secure.
Abstraction: Objects can be used to represent real-world entities, allowing programmers to work with objects rather than raw data.
Reusability: Objects can be reused in multiple applications, reducing development time and improving code quality.
Inheritance: Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, allowing for code reuse and simplification.


OOP is used in a wide range of industries and applications, including software development, web development, game development, and data science
