The shutil module in Python is a built-in library that provides a high-level interface for handling file operations. It offers various functions to work with files and directories, including copying, moving, renaming, and deleting them.

Here are some key functions available in the shutil module:

shutil.copy(src, dst): This function copies the file located at the path 'src' to the destination path 'dst'. If 'dst' is a directory, the file will be copied into that directory with the same filename.

shutil.copy2(src, dst): Similar to shutil.copy(), but this function also preserves the original file's metadata, such as timestamps.

shutil.move(src, dst): This function moves the file or directory at 'src' to the destination path 'dst'. If the 'dst' directory already exists, the 'src' will be placed inside it. If 'dst' doesn't exist, it will be considered as the new name for the 'src' file/directory.

shutil.rmtree(path): This function removes an entire directory tree (including all files and subdirectories) at the specified 'path'.

shutil.rename(src, dst): This function renames the file or directory at 'src' to the given 'dst' name or path.

These are just a few examples of commonly used functions in the shutil module. It provides many more functions and supports additional features like archiving and compressing files. You can refer to the Python documentation for a comprehensive list of available functions and more detailed descriptions.
