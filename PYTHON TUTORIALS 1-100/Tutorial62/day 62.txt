In object-oriented programming,
 an access modifier is a declaration that defines the visibility of members
  a  (fields, methods, etc.) of a class or its subclasses. 
  Access modifiers are used to control how code is organized 
nd to ensure that members are accessible only by those who should have access to them.


In Python, there are four access specifiers that can be used to control the visibility of class members and methods:

1.
public: Members and methods with this access level can be accessed from anywhere.
2.
protected: Members and methods with this access level can be accessed from within the class and its subclasses.
3.
private: Members and methods with this access level can only be accessed from within the class itself.
4.
private_method: This is a special type of method access that can only be accessed from within the class it is defined in.


Here's an example of a class with different access levels:
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self._private_variable = 100

    def public_method(self):
        print("This is a public method")

    def _protected_method(self):
        print("This is a protected method")

    def __private_method(self):
        print("This is a private method")

    def another_private_method(self):
        self.__private_method()

In this example, the public_method can be accessed from outside the class, while the _protected_method and __private_method can only be accessed from within the class or its subclasses. The another_private_method uses the self.__private_method() syntax to access the private method from within the class.
