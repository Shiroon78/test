A class method is a method that is bound to a class and not to an instance of the class.
It is defined using the @classmethod decorator, which takes a function and transforms it into a class method.
When you call a class method, the first argument is always cls, which represents the class itself and not an instance of the class.
Class methods can access class-level attributes and methods without having to create an instance of the class.
Class methods are often used for tasks that are common to all instances of a class, such as initializing the class, calculating a class-wide result, or performing operations on the class itself.
In some cases, class methods can be used as a substitute for static methods in other languages.


, here's an example of a class method in Python:
class ExampleClass:
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"Hello from {cls.__name__}")

ExampleClass.class_method()

In this example, class_method is a class method because it is defined using the @classmethod decorator. The decorator takes a function and transforms it into a class method.

When you call class_method(), it will first look for the current instance of the class (self) and then move up the class hierarchy to find the class itself (cls). This allows you to access class-level attributes and methods without having to create an instance of the class.
