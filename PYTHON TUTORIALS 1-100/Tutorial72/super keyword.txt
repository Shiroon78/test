The super() function in Python is used to access the parent class methods. It is used when a method in a derived class has the same name as a method in the base class, and you want to call the method in the base class.

The syntax for using the super() function is as follows:

super(class, object)

Here, class is the name of the base class, and object is an instance of the derived class.

For example, consider the following class hierarchy:

class Base:
    def base_method(self):
        print("Base method")

class Derived(Base):
    def derived_method(self):
        super().base_method()
        print("Derived method")

In this example, the Derived class inherits from the Base class. The derived_method() method calls the base_method() method in the base class using the super() function. This allows you to access the base class method even if it has the same name as the method in the derived class
