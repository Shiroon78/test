A regular expression (regex or RE) is, in simple terms, a search pattern. It is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, similar to how a recipe defines the ingredients and instructions for a dish.

In Python, regular expressions are implemented using the re module. To use regular expressions in Python, you can import the re module and use it to create a regular expression object. You can then use this object to search for matches in a string.

Here is a simple example of how to use regular expressions in Python:
import re

# Create a regular expression object that matches numbers
regex = re.compile(r'\d+')

# Search for numbers in a string
match = regex.search('This is a string with some numbers: 123, 456, and 789')

# Get the matched string
print(match.group())

# Output:
# 123

In this example, we created a regular expression object that matches numbers using the r'\d+' syntax. We then used the search method to search for numbers in a string. The search method returns a Match object, which we can use to get the matched string using the group method.

Regular expressions can be complex and powerful, but they are also easy to learn and can be a powerful tool for text processing in Python.
