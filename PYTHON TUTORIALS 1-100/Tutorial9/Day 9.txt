Type Casting is the method to convert the Python variable datatype into a 
certain data type in order to perform the required operation by users. 
In this article, we will see the various techniques for typecasting. 

There can be two types of Type Casting in Python:
    Python Implicit Type Conversion
    Python Explicit Type Conversion

    In this, method, Python converts the datatype into another datatype automatically. 
    Users donâ€™t have to involve in this process. 

Explicit Type Conversion in Python
