The request module is a popular library in Python that allows you to send HTTP requests easily. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests, handling headers, cookies, and authentication.

Here are some of the commonly used methods in the request module:

get(url): Sends a GET request to the specified URL and returns the response.

post(url, data): Sends a POST request to the specified URL with the provided data and returns the response.

put(url, data): Sends a PUT request to the specified URL with the provided data and returns the response.

delete(url): Sends a DELETE request to the specified URL and returns the response.

head(url): Sends a HEAD request to the specified URL and returns the response.

patch(url, data): Sends a PATCH request to the specified URL with the provided data and returns the response.

These methods can take additional parameters such as headers, cookies, and authentication details as arguments, allowing you to customize your requests further.

Here's an example of using the request module to send a GET request:


import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/posts')
print(response.status_code)  # Print the response status code
print(response.json())  # Print the response body as JSON
In this example, we import the requests module and use the get method to send a GET request to the specified URL. We then print the response's status code and its body, which is parsed as JSON using the .json() method.

Remember to install the requests module before using it by running pip install requests in your command prompt or terminal.
