A constructor is a special type of method in a class that is used to create an instance of the class.
 
 It is called automatically when you create a new instance of the class.In the example in the .py file, 
def __init__(self, n, o):
        print("Hey I am aperson")
        self.name = n
        self.occ = o.

The selected code defines the constructor for the Person class. The constructor takes two arguments, n (the person's name) and o (the person's occupation).

Within the constructor, the code first prints "Hey I am aperson" to the console. This is a simple message to indicate that the constructor has been executed.

Next, the code sets the name and occupation attributes of the Person object to the values passed in as arguments. In this case, the name attribute is set to n and the occupation attribute is set to o.

Finally, the code ends with a colon (:), indicating that the constructor's body is complete.
