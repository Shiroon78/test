n python, inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This is done using the class Child(Parent): syntax, where Child is the child class and Parent is the parent class.

Here is an example of a simple class hierarchy:
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def make_sound(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof! I am a {}!".format(self.breed))

dog1 = Dog("Max", "Labrador")
dog1.make_sound()
dog1.bark()

In this example, we have a Animal class that has an __init__ method to initialize the name attribute, and a make_sound method that prints "Animal makes a sound".

We then have a Dog class that inherits from Animal. The Dog class has an __init__ method that calls the parent class' __init__ method, and sets the breed attribute. It also has a bark method that prints a message with the dog's breed.

Finally, we create an instance of Dog and call the make_sound and bark methods


In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a way of reusing code by allowing one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. There are four types of inheritance in Python:

1.
Single Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a child class inherits only one parent class. The child class can inherit the properties and methods of only one parent class, but it can inherit multiple properties and methods from multiple parent classes in multiple inheritance.
2.
Multi-level Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a child class inherits from one or more parent classes, and those parent classes may in turn inherit from other classes. This type of inheritance can be used to create a hierarchy of classes, where each class inherits from one or more parent classes.


3.Hierarchical Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a child class inherits from more than one parent class, but only one parent class's methods and properties are inherited. The other parent classes are used as a base class, and their methods and properties can be used by the child class.

4.Hybrid Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a child class inherits from more than one parent class, but the properties and methods of each parent class are combined to create a new class. This type of inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance.
